            <h3>A Student Information System (SIS) is basically a software solution that enables educational institutions to digitize and consequently manage student information more efficiently. More specifically, it’s a system that allows educational institutions of all stripes to make all student information — that was previously stored in legacy systems — available online. In doing so, they manage to automate related administrative and academic processes, thus making them much more efficient. On top of that, they also succeed in supporting students’ needs — both inside and outside the classroom — in the best possible way.

                How does a Student Information System work?

                Nowadays, people tend to increasingly have more stress because of the bad economy, high living expenses, etc. Listening to music is a key activity that assists to reduce stress. However, it may be unhelpful if the music does not suit the current emotion of the listener. Moreover, there is no music player which is able to select songs based on the user emotion. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an emotion-based music player, which is able to suggest songs based on the user's emotions; sad, happy, neutral and angry. The application receives either the user's heart rate or facial image from a smart band or mobile camera. It then uses the classification method to identify the user's emotion. This paper presents 2 kinds of the classification method; the heart rate-based and the facial image-based methods. Then, the application returns songs which have the same mood as the user's emotion. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to precisely classify the happy emotion because the heart rate range of this emotion is wide.
